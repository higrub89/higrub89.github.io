            <h2>My story in detail</h2>
            <p>With a solid 10-year track record as a professional mechanic, I have dedicated my career to technical excellence and the perfection of high-end automotive systems for internationally renowned brands. My direct experience with the mechanical complexity of motorcycles, off-road vehicles, and automobiles, including MV Agusta, Ducati, Bimota, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Yamaha, Honda, and Aprilia, has equipped me with an intimate understanding of precision engineering, meticulous attention to detail, and an exceptional ability to diagnose and resolve complex problems under pressure.</p>

            <p>My passion for innovation and the constant evolution of the automotive sector was what led me to a turning point. I recognized that the future of the automobile lies as much in hardware as, increasingly, in software. This vision prompted me to undertake a bold and exciting transition into software development, immersing myself in the rigorous and collaborative methodology of **42 Madrid**. Here, I am cultivating and honing my skills in low-level programming with **Linux, C, C++, Python**, **Unix** systems management, and **algorithm** optimization, applying them to programming challenges that demand creativity and efficiency.</p>

            <p>My ultimate goal is to merge my deep experience in the world of luxury mechanics with the transformative power of code. I aspire to be a key developer in the automotive industry, creating innovative solutions that address the most complex challenges, from smart diagnostic systems and advanced telematics to software architecture for connected and autonomous vehicles.</p>

            <p>As a professional, I am guided by principles of sophistication, flawless functionality, and an unwavering dedication to quality. These values, forged over years of working with automotive excellence, now guide my development as a programmer. My unique background allows me to bring a holistic perspective, understanding not only how software is built but also how it interacts with the physical engineering of the vehicle, ensuring that every line of code contributes to a seamless driving experience. My commitment goes beyond logic; I seek to infuse every project with the same passion for excellence found in a high-precision engine or the design of a classic watch.</p>
